# GHG Emissions Analysis

### Project Overview
---

<p align="justify"> This project provides insights into GHG emissions over the years (2017-2022) for a company operating in the sales industry. By analyzing the various scopes (1,2,3), it is possible to identify trends and, with a theoretical connection to a dedicated database, track the carbon footprint on an ongoing basis. In addition, such a dashboard allows to pull ad-hoc data, which could also effectively expedite the reporting of non-financial data. The dashboard includes metrics that calculate intensity ratios based on the surface area of buildings used by the entity (which comply with GRI standards).</p>
The dashboard was made using the Power BI tool.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for the analysis was fully fabricated. However, the values are based on real data generated by a company operating in the sales industry.
